# Hello, world
I'm really glad to be here today—and I'd like to apologise in advance: Last Friday I fell off my bike and messed up my lips and a couple of teeth. This means my normally funny Scandinavian accent is going to sound even funnier than normal. I'll go slow, though—which I'll need as this entire session will be based on screen-sharing: as I've got HTML slides and will be showing off my entire dev environment.

As I know there is a mixed skillset in attendance here today, this session will start off with a very quick comparison of the various build tools out there and their strengths and weaknesses, before diving into more advanced examples of what you can actually do with them that isn't just your average every-day "Compile your Sass and minify your stuff". Although I'll cover that too!

So let's get this started!
